"""Real-time streaming recitation session (Tarteel-style live tracking).

This service backs the ``/ws/recitation/stream`` WebSocket. Unlike the
upload → Redis-Stream → worker flow (batch analysis of a finished recording),
a :class:`StreamingRecitationSession` processes a **continuous audio stream**
while the user is still reciting and emits **word-by-word** match events in
real time.

Flow
----
1. The client opens the WebSocket and sends a ``start`` message (surah / ayah).
2. The session resolves the expected (reference) word list for the ayah(s).
3. The client streams raw PCM16 mono 16 kHz audio frames (binary messages).
4. Periodically the session re-transcribes the accumulated audio and feeds the
   cumulative hypothesis into a :class:`ml.alignment.streaming_matcher.StreamingMatcher`.
   Newly-resolved reference words are emitted as ``word`` events
   (matched / error / skipped).
5. On ``stop`` the session writes the full recording to disk, builds the
   mobile-shaped :class:`RecitationAnalysisResult` blob (so history + A/B
   playback keep working) and returns a ``final`` event.

The transcriber is pluggable. A lightweight duration-based stub is available
only when ``QARI_ML_USE_STUB`` is explicitly set (for tests and demos). A
missing real model must fail the session rather than awarding words merely as
time passes.

# How many seconds of *new* audio to accumulate before re-transcribing.
TRANSCRIBE_INTERVAL_SEC = 1.2
# --- Early first pass (2026-09-26): cut the first-word latency ---------------
#
# Measured decomposition of the ~2.1 s first-word latency on this 4-vCPU VPS:
#   ~1.2 s waiting for TRANSCRIBE_INTERVAL_SEC of audio to accumulate, plus
#   ~1.0-1.1 s for the unprompted decode of the 6.0+1.5 s window.
# The steady-state interval and window are NOT changed (recorded regressions:
# a 5.0 s window stalled the end of the surah, VERIFY_EVERY_N_PASSES=2 produced
# 5-13 s apparent latency). Instead ONLY the very first pass of a session is
# allowed to fire early, on a shorter window:
#
#   * EARLY_FIRST_PASS_SEC       audio required before pass #1 (was 1.2 s)
#   * EARLY_FIRST_PASS_WINDOW_S  window length for pass #1 (was 7.5 s)
#
# A shorter window also decodes faster, so this attacks BOTH terms. It applies
# once per session; the normal interval/window resume immediately afterwards.
# SAFETY: a very short window is where Whisper hallucinates, so this is gated on
# the same SILENCE_RMS_THRESHOLD check as every other pass, and the output is
# still only accepted through the unchanged matcher corroboration path.
#
# *** DEFAULT IS OFF — MEASURED NEGATIVE RESULT, DO NOT SIMPLY RE-ENABLE ***
# Enabling it made first-word latency WORSE, not better:
#     OFF : 2094 / 2119 / 2131 / 2139 / 2185 ms   (p50 ~2131)
#     ON  : 3137 / 3139 / 3142 / 3145 ms          (p50 ~3142)  <- +1.0 s WORSE
# Cause: 0.5 s of audio is below what Whisper needs to emit a usable
# transcript, so the "early" pass spends a full ~1 s decode producing nothing,
# and the real first word is pushed out by exactly that wasted decode. The
# window reduction does not help either: decode cost is independent of window
# length (measured: 7.5 s and 2.5 s windows both decode in 0.977 s) because
# Whisper pads input to 30 s internally.
#
# The ~1 s decode is a hard per-pass floor on this CPU, so there is no window /
# interval tuning that gets to 400 ms. Reaching it needs the GPU migration or a
# VAD + forced-alignment path that never runs Whisper per pass.
#
# The code and the env knobs are kept (QARI_EARLY_FIRST_PASS=1 to re-enable, and
# QARI_EARLY_FIRST_PASS_SEC to retune) so the negative result is reproducible
# rather than folklore. The loop-cadence coupling fix below is kept because it

# --- Sliding-window transcription (fixes unbounded live lag) ----------------
# The OLD live loop re-transcribed the ENTIRE growing audio buffer on every
# pass, so per-pass cost grew with recitation length. On a CPU VPS each Whisper
# pass already takes ~2.5-4s (base) which is slower than the 1.2s cadence, so the
# reveal fell further and further behind real time (worse with the bigger model).
#
# Instead we transcribe only a bounded WINDOW of the most recent audio each pass
# and STITCH the new words onto a cumulative `_hypothesis` list (the
# StreamingMatcher requires a cumulative hypothesis — it resumes at `_hyp_cursor`
# and never re-scans resolved words). Per-pass cost is now ~constant (bounded by
# the window length), so the reveal keeps up regardless of recitation length.
#
# The window (+ OVERLAP) controls both context and reveal latency. Tried a
# shorter 5.0s window: faster cadence but it lost the boundary-word context
# and stalled the end of the surah, so 6.0s stays. Latency is instead kept
# down by making each pass cheaper (unprompted verification runs on alternate
# passes — see _verify_every) and by the decode caps in the transcriber.
TRANSCRIBE_WINDOW_SEC = 6.0
# Run the unprompted verification decode only every N-th pass. Successive
# windows overlap heavily, so a verification set stays valid for the next
# pass; skipping the verification on alternate passes halves the average pass
# cost.
# NOTE: this MUST stay 1 in production. With N=2 the tier-2 evidence set is up
# to two passes (~4s) STALE, so a word the user has just spoken is not yet in
# it, tier-1 gets filtered as "uncorroborated" and the reveal waits for the
# next refresh — measured 5-13s apparent word latency over a full-surah
# recitation (the "words stop appearing" symptom). The concurrent tier-1 +
# tier-2 decode is ~2s, which the cadence absorbs, so fresh evidence every
# pass costs little and is what keeps the reveal tracking the voice.

# the window boundary is CUT IN HALF: the model sees only the word's tail in
# the next window and emits a broken fragment (e.g. 'ٰطَ' for 'صِرَٰطَ')
# that matches nothing — the matcher stalls and live events stop (observed
# at ayah boundaries in full-surah sessions). The overlap keeps the whole
# boundary word inside the window; stitch_hypothesis() already dedups the
# repeated tail (STITCH_MAX_OVERLAP_WORDS).

# When the user is quiet, the mic still streams low-level room noise and Whisper
# frequently HALLUCINATES Arabic-looking tokens on near-silent audio. Those
# phantom words flowed into the matcher and "completed" the ayah automatically
# even though the user said nothing. We measure the RMS energy of each
# transcribed window and, when it is below this floor, treat the segment as
# silence: skip transcription entirely and emit NO word events (so nothing
# resolves until the user actually recites). 16-bit PCM normalized to [-1, 1];
# a calm room is typically ~0.002–0.01, speech is >0.02. Set conservatively low
# so only near-total silence (the user not reciting at all) is gated — quiet

#       actually said. Measured on this VPS: 29/29 words revealed live on a real
#       Al-Fatiha recitation (repeatedly), and only 7/29 on an unrelated clip
#       (Fatiha's repeated words, textually ambiguous).
#   "corroborated": the prompt-conditioned Qari model supplies the words, kept
#       only where the independent decode agrees. Cleaner segmentation, but the
#       Qari model is an ORACLE (see _independent_transcriber): its echo of the
#       expected text passes corroboration whenever the independent decode heard
#       *any* occurrence of the same word, so it over-reveals (measured 9/29 on
#       the same unrelated clip).
#
