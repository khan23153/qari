"""Incremental word alignment for live Quran recitation tracking.

Qari compares ASR text with the Quranic reference using fuzzy string matching,
aligns words with a local Needleman-Wunsch (DP) sequence alignment, and anchors
the search to the last known position. This describes Qari's implementation;
Tarteel's current proprietary matcher is not established by its public notes.

The previous implementation used a one-way greedy cursor: it walked the
hypothesis token stream once and never re-scanned it, consuming every
unmatched token as "noise". Whenever the expected word's token was missing
(window-cut fragment, prompt echo, a swallowed word) the cursor simply stopped
advancing and NO further live word could ever resolve — the exact "words stop
appearing mid-surah" failure. The anchor + local-window DP below is monotonic
but re-aligns the whole recent window on every pass, so a missing or mangled
word is skipped and the reveal continues.
